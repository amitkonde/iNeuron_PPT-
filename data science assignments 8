Title: Thyroid Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Project Overview:

The project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting thyroid disease based on input data such as patient's medical history, symptoms, and laboratory test results.
The model will be trained on a labeled dataset containing data from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease and healthy individuals.
The goal is to accurately classify new patient data as either "Thyroid Disease" or "No Thyroid Disease" based on the trained model.
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a diverse dataset of patient data, including medical records, laboratory test results, and symptoms related to thyroid disease.
Clean and preprocess the dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and identify any patterns or correlations.
Feature Selection and Engineering:

Conduct feature selection to identify the most relevant features that contribute to thyroid disease detection.
Explore different feature engineering techniques, such as creating new features based on domain knowledge or transforming existing features to enhance their predictive power.
Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the classification task, considering factors such as interpretability, scalability, and performance.
Compare different algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks, based on their suitability for the problem.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and validation sets, using stratified sampling to handle imbalanced classes.
Train the selected machine learning model on the training data.
