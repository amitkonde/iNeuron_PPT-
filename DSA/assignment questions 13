Question 1
Given two linked list of the same size, the task is to create a new linked list using those linked lists. The condition is that the greater node among both linked list will be added to the new linked list.
Examples: Input: list1 = 5->2->3->8 list2 = 1->7->4->5 Output: New list = 5->7->4->8

Input:list1 = 2->8->9->3 list2 = 5->3->6->4 Output: New list = 5->8->9->4

Algorithm
1.Initialize a dummy node as the head of the new linked list.

2.Initialize two pointers, ptr1 and ptr2, pointing to the heads of the input linked lists list1 and list2, respectively.

3.Initialize a current pointer curr to point to the dummy node.

4.While both ptr1 and ptr2 are not None:

5.Compare the values of ptr1 and ptr2.

6.If the value of ptr1 is greater or equal to the value of ptr2, create a new node with the value of ptr1 and assign it to the next of curr. Move ptr1 to the next node.

7.Otherwise, create a new node with the value of ptr2 and assign it to the next of curr. Move ptr2 to the next node.

8.Move curr to its next node.

9.If ptr1 is not None, append the remaining nodes of list1 to the new linked list by assigning the next of curr to ptr1.

10.If ptr2 is not None, append the remaining nodes of list2 to the new linked list by assigning the next of curr to ptr2.

11.Return the next of the dummy node as the head of the new linked list.

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def createNewList(list1, list2):
    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node to simplify the insertion
    curr = dummy

    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val >= list2.val:
            curr.next = ListNode(list1.val)
            list1 = list1.next
        else:
            curr.next = ListNode(list2.val)
            list2 = list2.next

        curr = curr.next

    # Append the remaining nodes from list1 or list2 if any
    if list1:
        curr.next = list1
    elif list2:
        curr.next = list2

    return dummy.next
list1 = ListNode(5)
list1.next = ListNode(2)
list1.next.next = ListNode(3)
list1.next.next.next = ListNode(8)

list2 = ListNode(1)
list2.next = ListNode(7)
list2.next.next = ListNode(4)
list2.next.next.next = ListNode(5)

newList = createNewList(list1, list2)

while newList:
    print(newList.val, end=' ')
    newList = newList.next
5 2 3 8 1 7 4 5 
Question 2
Write a function that takes a list sorted in non-decreasing order and deletes any duplicate nodes from the list. The list should only be traversed once.
For example if the linked list is 11->11->11->21->43->43->60 then removeDuplicates() should convert the list to 11->21->43->60.

Example 1: Input: LinkedList: 11->11->11->21->43->43->60 Output: 11->21->43->60 Example 2: Input: LinkedList: 10->12->12->25->25->25->34 Output: 10->12->25->34

Algorithm
1.If the input linked list is empty or has only one node, return the list as it is since there are no duplicates.

2.Initialize a pointer current to point to the head of the linked list.

3.Iterate through the list using a while loop until the current node and its next node are not None:

4.If the value of the current node and its next node are equal, skip the next node by updating the next of the current node to the next of the next node. This effectively removes the duplicate node from the list.

5.If the value of the current node and its next node are not equal, move the current pointer to the next node.

6.Return the modified linked list.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.data = value
        self.next = None

# Function to remove duplicates from a sorted linked list
def removeDuplicates(head):
    # If the list is empty or has only one node
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head

    current = head

    # Traverse the list
    while current is not None and current.next is not None:
        if current.data == current.next.data:
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next

    return head

# Create a sorted linked list with duplicate nodes
head = Node(11)
head.next = Node(11)
head.next.next = Node(11)
head.next.next.next = Node(21)
head.next.next.next.next = Node(43)
head.next.next.next.next.next = Node(43)
head.next.next.next.next.next.next = Node(60)

# Print the original linked list
current = head
print("Original Linked List: ", end="")
while current is not None:
    print(current.data, end="->")
    current = current.next
print("None")

# Remove duplicates from the linked list
head = removeDuplicates(head)

# Print the modified linked list after removing duplicates
current = head
print("Modified Linked List: ", end="")
while current is not None:
    print(current.data, end="->")
    current = current.next
print("None")
Original Linked List: 11->11->11->21->43->43->60->None
Modified Linked List: 11->21->43->60->None
Question 3
Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed (See Example 2 for clarification).
Example 1: Input: LinkedList: 1->2->2->4->5->6->7->8 K = 4 Output:4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5 Explanation: The first 4 elements 1,2,2,4 are reversed first and then the next 4 elements 5,6,7,8. Hence, the resultant linked list is 4->2->2->1->8->7->6->5. Example 2: Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5 K = 3 Output:3 2 1 5 4 Explanation: The first 3 elements are 1,2,3 are reversed first and then elements 4,5 are reversed.Hence, the resultant linked list is 3->2->1->5->4.

Algorithm
1.Define a function reverseKNodes that takes the head of the linked list and the value of k as input.

2.Initialize three pointers: current to keep track of the current node, prev to keep track of the previous node, and next to keep track of the next node.

3.Traverse the linked list using the current pointer. At each step, perform the following operations:

4.Store the next node of current in the next pointer.

5.Reverse the links between current and prev by setting current.next to prev.

6.Move prev to current and current to next.

7.Repeat these steps k times or until the end of the list is reached.

8.After reversing the k nodes, check if there are more nodes in the list (current is not None). If there are, recursively call the reverseKNodes function on the next k nodes and update the head of the reversed list.

9.Finally, return the new head of the reversed list.

# Define the Node class
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.data = value
        self.next = None

# Function to reverse every k nodes in a linked list

    # Reverse the first k nodes
    while current is not None and count < k:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
        count += 1

    # Recursively reverse the remaining nodes
    if current is not None:
        head.next = reverseKNodes(current, k)

    return prev

# Function to print the linked list
def printLinkedList(head):
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        print(current.data, end=" ")

# Print the original linked list
print("Original Linked List:")
printLinkedList(head)

# Reverse every 4 nodes in the linked list

head = reverseKNodes(head, k)

# Print the reversed linked list
print("Reversed Linked List:")

3.Traverse the linked list using the current pointer. At each step, perform the following operations:

4.Store the next node of current in the next pointer.

5.Reverse the links between current and prev by setting current.next to prev.

6.Move prev to current and current to next.

7.Repeat these steps k times or until the end of the list is reached.

8.After reversing the k nodes, check if there are more nodes in the list (current is not None). If there are, skip the next k nodes by recursively calling the reverseAlternateKNodes function on the next k nodes.

9.Finally, return the new head of the reversed list.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.data = value

Question 5
Given a linked list and a key to be deleted. Delete last occurrence of key from linked. The list may have duplicates.
Examples:

Input: 1->2->3->5->2->10, key = 2 Output: 1->2->3->5->10

Algorithm
1.Initialize two pointers, prev and last, to keep track of the previous and last occurrence of the key respectively.

2.Traverse the linked list from the beginning and update the last pointer whenever the key is found.

3.Keep updating the prev pointer to keep track of the previous node.

4.After traversing the entire linked list, if the last pointer is None, it means the key is not found in the linked list. In this case, no deletion is required, so return the head of the linked list.

5.If the last pointer is not None, it means the key is found, so delete the last occurrence of the key:

6.If the last occurrence is the first node, update the head of the linked list to the next node.

7.Otherwise, update the next pointer of the previous node (prev.next) to skip the last occurrence node.

8.Return the modified head of the linked list.
